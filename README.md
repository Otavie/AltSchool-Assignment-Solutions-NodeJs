# ALTSCHOOL ASSIGNMENT SOLUTIONS NODEJS REPOSITORY

Welcome to the AltSchool Assignment Solutions NodeJs repository! This repository is designed to provide you with a structured collection of assignments to enhance your Node.js skills. Each assignment folder represents a set of tasks that I did as an AltSchool student. The repository is not open for public contributions, as it is meant for educational purposes and individual learning.

## Getting Started

To get started with the assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AltSchool-Assignment-Solutions-NodeJs.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. Explore the repository's contents. You will find multiple assignment folders, each labeled "Assignment-1," "Assignment-2," and so on.

3. Choose an assignment folder you want to work on, and navigate to it using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd AltSchool-Assignment-Solutions-NodeJs/Assignment-X
```

Replace `X` with the assignment number you want to work on.

4. Inside each assignment folder, you will find a `README.md` file that contains detailed instructions for the tasks that I have completed.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized with the following folder structure:

```
AltSchool Africa Assignment/
├── Assignment-1/
│   ├── task1.js
