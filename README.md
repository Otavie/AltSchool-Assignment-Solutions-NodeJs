# AltSchool Africa Assignment - Node.js Programs

This directory contains Node.js programs for various tasks as part of the AltSchool Africa assignment. The programs showcase different features and functionalities using built-in modules in Node.js.

## Task 1: Node.js Program using path, os, and process modules

The `path_os_process.js` file contains a Node.js program that demonstrates the usage of the `path`, `os`, and `process` modules to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Print out the current working directory.
2. Print out the separator of a given file path.
3. Print out the extension name of a file path.
4. Print out the process ID of the current running process.
5. Print out the user information of the operating system.
6. Print out the platform of the operating system.

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node path_os_process.js
```

Ensure you replace the `filePath` variable in Tasks 1.2 and 1.3 with the desired file path you want to examine.

## Task 2: Using the FS module

The `file_operations.js` file contains a Node.js program that demonstrates file system operations using the `fs` module. It covers the following tasks:

1. Create a directory/folder named "Students."
2. Inside the "Students" directory, create a file named "user.js."
3. Update the "Students" directory to "Names."
4. Add your name as content to the file "user.js."
5. Update the file and add your age, sex, nationality, phone number, and any other information about yourself.
6. Update the file "user.js" to {your_name}.js, for example, "daniel_adesoji.js."
7. Read the contents from {your_name}.js using `fs.open` or `fs.readFile`.
8. Delete the file {your_name}.js.
9. Delete the directory "Names."

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node file_operations.js
```

Ensure you modify the file content with your personal information.

## Task 3: Using the HTTP module

The `http_server.js` file contains a Node.js program that creates an HTTP server and returns "Hello world" as the response.

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node http_server.js
```

When you navigate to the server in your web browser, you should see "Hello world" as the response.
